Electronics and programming introduction
----------------------------------------

The Polish version of `electronics` and `programming` based on teaching materials from https://www.opcode.eu.org/ (sources https://github.com/opcode-eu-org-website).
AI tools (chat GPT) have been used for text editing of some materials.

The English version is AI translated (chat GPT) from the Polish version.

### TODO

* check the English version (and backport it to upstream)
* auto generate markdown files from upstream (or direct use html version of upstream)
